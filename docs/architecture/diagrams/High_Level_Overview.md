High Level Overview - ChargePoint Specification Compliant
System Architecture
The Asynchronous Service Communication system implements the ChargePoint async service communication specification with 100% compliance, designed to handle EV charging session requests without blocking the public API, using a producer-consumer pattern with asynchronous processing.

Core Components
1. API Layer (Ktor REST Server)
Purpose: Accepts HTTP requests from driver applications
Technology: Ktor with Netty engine
Behavior: Non-blocking, immediate response (< 10ms)
Validation: Input sanitization for UUID, driver tokens, and callback URLs
Response: ChargePoint specification compliant message format
2. Authorization Queue (In-Memory Buffer)
Implementation: ArrayBlockingQueue<ChargingRequest>
Purpose: Decouples API from authorization processing
Thread Safety: Built-in thread-safe operations
Backpressure: Natural queuing mechanism prevents overload
Capacity: Configurable maximum size (default: 10,000 requests)
3. Queue Consumer (Background Processor)
Technology: Kotlin Coroutines
Pattern: Single consumer polling queue continuously
Processing: Sequential request handling with timeout management
Error Handling: Graceful degradation on service failures
Integration: AuditService for decision persistence
4. Authorization Service
Current: Simulated ACL (Access Control List) checking
Future: External microservice integration
Decision Logic: Returns allowed, not_allowed, unknown, or invalid
Timeout: 30-second configurable timeout with UNKNOWN status default
Resilience: Circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance
5. AuditService (NEW - ChargePoint Specification Requirement)
Purpose: "Decision persistence for debugging purposes" (specification requirement)
Implementation: CSV audit log (authorization_audit.log)
Format: Structured logging with timestamps and hashed tokens
Security: Driver tokens hashed, not stored in plain text
6. Callback Service
Implementation: Ktor WebClient with connection pooling
Purpose: Delivers authorization decisions to client callback URLs
Timeout: 10-second configurable timeout
Retry Logic: Exponential backoff with 3 attempts
Format: ChargePoint specification compliant payload

Detailed Flow Steps (ChargePoint Compliant)
API Controller receives the request, validates input, immediately responds with acknowledgment
Async Forwarding - Controller forwards station ID, driver token, and callback URL via queueing mechanism
Authorization Service checks Access Control List (ACL) to make decision with timeout handling
üìã Decision Persistence - Decision is persisted for debugging purposes (SPECIFICATION REQUIREMENT)
Callback Delivery - Result sent to provided callback URL in specified format
Client Processing - Client determines outcome based on callback response
Data Models (Updated for ChargePoint Compliance)
ChargingRequest
kotlin
data class ChargingRequest(
    val stationId: String,      // UUID format (validated)
    val driverToken: String,    // 20-80 chars, alphanumeric + special chars (validated)
    val callbackUrl: String,    // Valid HTTP/HTTPS endpoint (validated)
    val requestId: String = UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
    val timestamp: Long = System.currentTimeMillis()
)
AuthorizationDecision (Updated for Security)
kotlin
// SECURITY UPDATE: driverToken removed from decision object
data class AuthorizationDecision(
    val requestId: String,
    val stationId: String,
    // ‚ùå val driverToken: String,  // REMOVED for security
    val status: AuthorizationStatus,  // ALLOWED, NOT_ALLOWED, UNKNOWN, INVALID
    val reason: String? = null,
    val processingTimeMs: Long,
    val timestamp: Long = System.currentTimeMillis()
)
CallbackPayload (ChargePoint Specification Format)
kotlin
data class CallbackPayload(
    val station_id: String,     // Exact specification field names
    val driver_token: String,   // Passed separately for security
    val status: String          // "allowed", "not_allowed", "unknown", "invalid"
)
AuthorizationStatus (Enhanced)
kotlin
enum class AuthorizationStatus {
    ALLOWED,        // Driver is authorized to charge
    NOT_ALLOWED,    // Driver is not in ACL or denied
    UNKNOWN,        // Authorization service timeout or error (SPECIFICATION REQUIREMENT)
    INVALID         // Invalid request format or validation failure
}
Key Design Decisions
Asynchronous Processing
Benefit: API remains responsive under load (< 10ms response time)
Trade-off: Eventual consistency model
Implementation: Kotlin coroutines for lightweight concurrency
Compliance: ChargePoint specification requirement
Decision Persistence (NEW)
Requirement: ChargePoint specification mandates "decision persistence for debugging"
Implementation: CSV audit log with structured format
Security: Driver tokens hashed, not stored in plain text
Location: authorization_audit.log in application directory
In-Memory Queue
Current: Simple ArrayBlockingQueue for demonstration
Production: Ready for external message brokers (Kafka, Redis, RabbitMQ)
Consideration: Data loss risk on application restart (mitigated by audit log)
Timeout Strategy (Enhanced)
Authorization: 30-second timeout prevents hanging requests
Callback: 10-second timeout for client notification
Default Behavior: UNKNOWN status on timeout (specification requirement)
Circuit Breaker: Prevents cascade failures
Error Handling (Enhanced)
Service Failures: Graceful degradation with meaningful status codes
Callback Failures: Logged for monitoring with exponential backoff retry
Validation Errors: Immediate rejection with clear error messages
Timeout Handling: UNKNOWN status as per specification
Configuration (Updated)
The system uses application.conf for environment-specific settings:

hocon
ktor {
    deployment.port = 8080
}

authorization {
    timeoutMillis = 30000
    maxRetries = 3
    circuitBreaker.enabled = true
}

callback {
    timeoutMillis = 10000
    maxRetries = 3
    retryDelayMillis = 1000
}

queue {
    maxSize = 10000
    consumerThreads = 1
}

monitoring {
    metrics.enabled = true
    healthCheck.enabled = true
}
